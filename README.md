 # **Jasmine's Tic Tac Toe Project**

### Technologies Used Include:
#### -HTML
#### -CSS
#### -Bootstrap
#### -Javascript
#### -Jquery
#### -AJAX

### Planning:

* My original planning started with creating a wireframe based off of what I wanted my SPA to look like. However, things did not go to plan. When I first began the Tic Tac Toe Project, I originally started with the recommended schedule that starts with building the Authentication specifications. I ran into several problems after the first day of working on my project. One being of how to enter in text into an HTML element! I used the issue queue. However, looking back, I could have reffered to my notes for this! Then from there I built the Authentication forms and then from there my game logic and API Specifications. I have learned a lot from collaboration with other peers in my course.

### Unsolved Issues:

* My project is currently only the MVP. I have not added any special features outside of the project requirements to pass. In the future I would love to make the screen more readable when first logging in. It would be nice to have the change password and sign out on a nav bar on the top of the page. The game grid also expands upon expanding your browser, that will need to be fixed. It would also be nice to add some nice CSS features to my grid and make it more appealing in that sense. In addition, I would like to add more to the getGames function to retrieve more than the number of games a player has used. It would be great to add other games to my SPA as well other than Tic Tac Toe.

### Please See User Stores Below:

1. As a game user, I want to be able to know who won or lost the game so that I know when the game is over.
2. As a webpage user, I want be able to log out of the game so know one else can play under my email address.
3. As a user, I want to be able to see how many tic-tac-toe games I have played so that I can keep track.
4. As a user, I want to be able to sign in so that I can have my game data stored in my account.
5. As a user, I want to be able to play a new game without having to sign in again because it is faster to play this way.
